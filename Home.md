# New Valley Tech WIKI

The purpose of this Wiki is to provide a reference for all of the technologies implemented at NVC.  It is a collaborative roadmap (_**collaborative meaning YOU can participate in editing and creating this document**_) outlining all of the technologies, hardware and software, used to put on a weekly Sunday morning service and supporting events throughout the course of a normal week.
