# Technology Roadmap for NVC

The purpose of this Wiki is to provide a reference for all of the technologies implemented at NVC.  It is a collaborative roadmap outlining all of the technologies, hardware and software, used to put on a weekly Sunday morning service and supporting events throughout the course of a normal week.

Consider this a manual for the way we do things at NVC.
