### Screen Dimensions

The width of the display settings on the iMAC do not match the visible screen due to the number of overlapping pixels that are needed to stitch the screen together.  The overlap is 240 pixels.

- Due to the dimensions of the screen, which is a simple ratio of 24:8 or 3:1, anything you want to display full screen will need to be cropped, resized, or framed by the photographer/videographer such that the resulting image will brilliantly fit that ratio.  So, if you have a picture that's 1000 pixels tall, you need it to be 3000 pixels wide, and then it needs to be scaled to fit Pro-Presenter's slide size, which is 3600X1200. So, an image that's 3000X1200 will be slightly enlarged by Pro-Presenter to fit the screen, and in turn will lose some of it's resolution.  It's best to compose your shot with the end dimensions in mind.  440 vertical pixels of the top, bottom, or middle of the image or video will be unusable for backgrounds.

- Any media that fits inside of a given slide can be any standard or custom size as long as it's not intended to fill the entire screen.  Various background and slide templates can be created to facilitate the vision and make it easy for anyone to drag and drop the right sized media into those slides.

- All backgrounds need to be at a ratio of 24:8.  So, if you take a photo with a camera that creates an image at 1920X1080 which 16:9, it will need to be cropped to 1920X640.  That means we have to discard 440 pixels of the original image.  A potential solution is to use a camera that allows us to customize the viewfinder to create a virtual frame inside of the lens frame before the picture is taken.  Not sure if this exists.

I use [this little calculator here](https://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/aspect_ratio/) to quickly compare ratios for resizing, etc.
