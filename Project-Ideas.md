# Project Ideas

- Re-think the Service Types and consider adding a single service type for Sunday mornings with multiple start time schedules instead of two separate types.

- Create a Google form that connects to a Spreadsheet that mirrors the data structure of People.  Develop a Kiosk or simple web-interface that allows each user to submit their information to the database automatically.

# Notes and Observations

- Importing data from another source into People, requires that the spreadsheet (table) that the data is being imported **from** matches the data table that it needs to be imported **to**.
