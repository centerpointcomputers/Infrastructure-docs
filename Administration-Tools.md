# WELCOME

The intention behind this wiki is to create an account of the technologies that are in use at NVC and to paint a roadmap for, and track the evolution of the technologies we are using and may implement in the future.

## Current Tools (Incomplete List)

- Planning Center:
    - Services:  System to manage volunteers and serving, etc. <http://plannincenteronline.com>
- Roll Call: Handles check-ins to track attendance. <http://bythebook.com> 

## Tentatively Planned Implementation:

- Planning Center:
    - People: Database of **all** people involved in New Valley Church.  Connects to Services.
    - Check-ins:  System to manage attendance tracking for events.
    - Giving: System to manage giving resources.
    - Groups:  An easier way for the staff to manage the various groupings of people in the church.
